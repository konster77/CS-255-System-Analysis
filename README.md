# CS-255-System-Analysis
The DriverPass project centered on designing an online driver’s education platform to help users prepare for their driving tests. The client wanted a user-friendly, web-based system that provided interactive lessons, practice tests, and progress tracking to improve user engagement and success rates. Throughout the project, I excelled at gathering and analyzing user requirements, ensuring the system design addressed both functional and non-functional needs. One area I would revise is the clarity and organization of the system design document, particularly in the technical specifications section. I would improve it by incorporating more visual aids, such as diagrams and flowcharts, to make complex concepts easier to understand. Interpreting user needs played a key role in shaping the system design, as every decision—from user interface layout to backend functionality—was guided by the end-user experience. Prioritizing user needs is essential to create a system that is not only functional but also intuitive and accessible. My approach to designing software involves breaking down the project into clear phases: gathering requirements, creating mockups, drafting technical specifications, and iterative testing. I plan to incorporate more Agile methodologies, such as regular user feedback sessions and iterative prototyping, to ensure the final product aligns closely with user expectations and business goals.
